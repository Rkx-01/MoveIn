# Project Idea: Smart Temporary Housing Platform

## Overview

This project aims to build a verified temporary housing platform for students, interns, and working professionals who relocate to new cities for short durations (1–6 months).

Unlike traditional platforms that focus on tourism or permanent rentals, this system is optimized for temporary living with trust, verification, and affordability.

The platform connects tenants and verified property owners while ensuring safety, transparency, and ease of booking.

## Problem Statement

People moving cities face:

- Fake or misleading listings
- Unreliable hosts
- Hidden costs
- Poor short-term housing options
- Lack of trust

Existing platforms are optimized for tourism or long-term renting, not temporary relocation.

- Property owners list verified rooms/flats.
- Tenants search, filter, and book properties.
